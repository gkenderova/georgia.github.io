Hi! Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in <b>Human Centered Design and Engineering</b> (HCDE) at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Sean A. Munson](https://www.smunson.com/) and am currently researching ways to leverage narrative and storytelling to support mental health. I am specifically interested in understanding the impact of stories on our motivation for self-transformation.

I got my MS in HCDE from the University of Washington in 2023. I graduated from <b>Pomona College</b> in 2021, where I got a BA in Computer Science and Media Studies. During my time there, I was part of the <b>HCI Lab</b> where I researched online health communities for mental health and improving patient-provider collaboration alongside [Prof. Alexandra Papoutsaki](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~apapoutsaki/) and [Prof. Daniel Epstein](https://depstein.net/) (University of California, Irvine).

In my free time, youâ€™ll find me baking sourdough bread, crocheting, reading, traveling, or playing basketball/squash/`[insert sport]' with friends. I love all things history and mythology and am a massive ice cream fan. I also occasionally make short films for fun ðŸŽ¥

You can reach me at gak98 [at] uw [dot] edu.
