Hi! Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in <b>Human Centered Design and Engineering</b> (HCDE) at the University of Washington. I'm advised by [Dr. Sean A. Munson](https://www.smunson.com/) and am part of the Intentional Traces Collective (ITC). I specialize in qualitative methods, with my current research focusing on how we can <i>leverage storytelling to support mental health</i>. I am specifically interested in understanding how we can use narrative to reframe how we look at obstacles and, ultimately, how we can create better stories about ourselves. I believe the power of storytelling combined with a strong sense of community can help us shape better mental health futures. 

I'm also generally interested in how we can make health tech more fair and safe. My most recent research project examined the impact of the overturn of Roe v. Wade on period tracking and data privacy perceptions.

I got my MS in HCDE from the University of Washington in 2023. I graduated from <b>Pomona College</b> in 2021, where I got a B.A. in Computer Science and Media Studies. During my time there, I was part of the <b>HCI Lab</b> where I researched online health communities for mental health and improving patient-provider collaboration alongside [Prof. Alexandra Papoutsaki](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~apapoutsaki/) and [Prof. Daniel Epstein](https://depstein.net/) (University of California, Irvine).

In my free time, I like to bake sourdough bread, crochet, read (talk to me about your favorite books!), travel, and play/watch sports. I love all things history and mythology and am a massive ice cream fan. I'm a pretty big movie and TV show nerd, and I also occasionally make short films for fun ðŸŽ¥
