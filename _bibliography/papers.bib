  abstract = {People often turn to online health communities (OHCs) for peer support on their specific medical conditions and health-related concerns. Over time, core members in OHCs build a shared understanding of the medical conditions they support. Although prior work has studied how individuals function differently in active sensemaking mode compared to habitual mode, little is known about how OHCs disseminate their advice once their core members operate primarily in habitual mode. We qualitatively observe one such OHC, 'Surviving Antidepressants', to understand how collectively-built protocols are disseminated in the important domain of discontinuing psychiatric drugs. Psychiatric drugs are widely prescribed to treat mental health diagnoses, but, in certain cases, discontinuation might be clinically advisable. Unfortunately, some people experience severe withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, even when following medical advice, and thus turn to OHCs for support. We find that collectively-built protocols resemble medical advice and are delivered in a top-down fashion, with staff members being the primary source of informational support. In contrast, all members provide emotional support and exchange advice on navigating the medical system, while many express their distrust of the medical community and pharmaceutical companies. We also discuss the implications of OHCs offering advice outside of the medical system and offer suggestions for how OHCs can collaborate with healthcare providers to advance scientific knowledge and better support people living with medical conditions.},

  abstract = {Clinical decision support tools have typically focused on one-time support for diagnosis or prognosis, but have the ability to support providers in longitudinal planning of patient care regimens amidst infrastructural challenges. We explore an opportunity for technology support for discontinuing antidepressants, where clinical guidelines increasingly recommend gradual discontinuation over abruptly stopping to avoid withdrawal symptoms, but providers have varying levels of experience and diverse strategies for supporting patients through discontinuation. We conducted two studies with 12 providers, identifying providersâ€™ needs in developing discontinuation plans and deriving design guidelines. We then iteratively designed and implemented AT Planner, instantiating the guidelines by projecting taper schedules and providing flexibility for adjustment. Provider feedback on AT Planner highlighted that discontinuation plans required balancing interpersonal and infrastructural constraints and surfaced the need for different technological support based on clinical experience. We discuss the benefits and challenges of incorporating flexibility and advice into clinical planning tools.},
