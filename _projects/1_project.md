The overturn of Roe v. Wade led to growing concerns that law enforcement could request and use in court the personal data users share with period tracking apps ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/6/23196809/period-apps-roe-dobbs-data-privacy-abortion), [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/technology/period-tracker-privacy-abortion.html)). The media’s focus on discussions of data privacy in a post-Roe context and resulting recommendations to delete period-tracking apps begged the question of whether people were in fact making any changes in how they monitor their period in response to the overturn. Interested in examining if and how users are reacting to the Supreme Court decision and these calls from the media, we recruited participants from [states directly impacted by the overrule](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html) and conducted two rounds of semi-structured interviews with 22 participants (a total of 27 interviews). During these conversations, we inquired about people’s period-tracking habits, privacy concerns regarding period-tracking apps, and the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision on their period-tracking, other online behavior, and their daily lives. We analyzed the data using a thematic analysis approach and found that while most people were concerned about how their period data might be used in a post-Roe world, very few were making concrete changes, such as deleting their menstrual trackers, in response to the overturn. The lack of clarity around how the law applies to this health information was worrisome for many but, for the most part, was not concerning enough to inspire more drastic change (such as deleting period apps).

<h3>Research Question:</h3>

“How have people changed the way they track their period in response to the Supreme Court’s decision to overrule Roe v. Wade?”


<h3>Project Timeline</h3>

<p>This project began in the summer of 2022 shortly after the overturn of Roe v. Wade. We began recruiting participants at the beginning of August, with the first round of interviews starting a couple of weeks later. We conducted a second round of interviews in January-February 2024 to gain a more longitudinal understanding of any potential changes in privacy perceptions. As of October 2024, we reported our findings and recommendations in a paper soon to be submitted to an academic journal.</p>
